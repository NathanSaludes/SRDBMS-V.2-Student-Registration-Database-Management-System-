# Student Registraton Database Management System (SRDBMS)

## How to use?
In order to start using the program, you must run this using your dedicated IDE for java.
The app accepts two to three arguments:

1. `command/input file path` (the file that the program will scan)
2. `log file path` (to print the console outputs into a .dat file)
3. `database name` (the name you want for you database -optional)
